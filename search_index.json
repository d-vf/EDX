All changes that occur in the nature are caused by some form of energy exchange. Energy is therefore always a transference between systems and cannot be created or destroyed. This basically describes the first law of thermodynamics, the energy conservation principle. There are many forms of energy, but they can all be categorized in two groups: Potential energy describes the forms in which energy is stored in a system, like nuclear, chemical, gravitational, thermal; Kinetic energy describes the forms in which energy is transferred like work (mechanicalor electrical) or heat. 1.1.2 Power definition Power is the rate at which energy is transferred from or to a system and its unit is Watt which corresponds to 1 J per second Energy is a scalar unit and in the International System of Units (SI) is measured in Joule (J). 1 Joule is the energy exchanged, for example, while applying a force of 1 newton (N) to move a body for 1 meter (m), or passing a current of 1 ampere (A) in a resistance of 1 ohm (O) for 1 second (s) or, heating 1 g of air to increase 1 K. The first measurements of energy were done while measuring heat using a Calorimeter.It’s represents the energy required to increase 1ºC to 1g of water at 14.5ºC. In the case of energy the use of SI unit is not the standard.In fact, the unit that is used depends very much on the context.For example, when talking about electricity, the kilowatt-hour (kWh) is the most used unit; when talking about space heating and cooling,the British Thermal Unit (BTU) is still very common when talking about the energy consumption of a country, the Tonne of Oil Equivalent (toe) is still the prevailing unit. \\[E (kWh) = P(W) \\times t (hr)1000\\] Where: \\(E\\): Energy (unit of, measured in kWh) \\(P\\): Power (unit, measured in Watts) \\(T\\): time period (measured in hours) 1.2 Energy System Energy system is a well-defined system in which energy flows enter the system to perform certain activities. It can be converted into multiple forms (energy output) and according to the second law of thermodynamics, a fraction of it is always lost in the conversion process.It may represent, for example, a car engine, a house, a machine or the country’s energy system.In any energy system, we have some energy conversion process, which is the process of changing one form of energy to another. The metric that measures the energy conversion efficiency is called the system efficiency. Is the ratio between the Energy Output over the Energy Input. Remember that this value may be smaller than one (e.g. in thermal engines) or greater than one (e.g. in heat pump systems). 1.2.0.1 First law Efficiency The first law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, but can be converted from one form to another. As an equation: \\[E_{system} = 0 = E_{in} – E_{out}\\] \\[W_{cycle} = Q_{out} - Q_{in}\\] or \\[\\gamma = \\frac{Q_{out}}{W} = \\frac{Q_{out}}{Q_{out}-Q_{in}} =\\frac{1}{1-\\frac{Q_{in}}{Q_{out}}}\\] 1.2.0.2 Energy Efficiency \\(\\mu\\) (as %): Energy conversion efficiency \\(\\mu\\) is the ratio between the useful output of an energy conversion machine and the input. \\(\\mu = \\frac{energy \\, output}{energy \\, input} \\times 100\\) 1.2.1 Reference Energy System It is a representation of all of the technical activities required to supply various forms of energy to end-use activities. An accounting framework for compilation of data on all energy products entering, exiting and used within a system (e.g. the national territory of a given country) during a reference period. It is a diagram that represents activities and the technologies and energy flows from primary energy supply to final energy use and eventually (though not as common) useful energy flows and energy services. The reference energy system is a framework that helps to describe an energy system by describing the energy flows, the energy conversion technologies and the energy outputs.In practice, the reference energy system is a diagram that represents technologies and processes and the energy flows between these. In particular, we introduce now three new concepts: the primary, final and useful energy.The breakdown of primary to final to useful energy is very relevant, because with each conversion step some energy is always lost.

Cullen, Engineering Fundamentals of Energy Efficiency, PhD Thesis, Cam, Figure 3.1 The flow-path of energy p. 49, avaiable at: link The design of an efficient energy system consists in avoiding unnecessary losses, we always aim at eliminating unnecessary steps in the flow of energy. Primary energy is the energy embodied in natural resources which involve extraction, (e.g. oil and coal, but also wind and solar).Primary energy refers to energy sources as found in the nature Final energy is the result of the transformation of primary energy sources the energy embodied in commodities which involve human transformation (e.g. electricity or gasoline or LPG) and it is usually, Energy that is avaiable at the consumer level. Useful energy is the energy really spent at the end-use technologies.The portion of final energy which is actually available after final conversion to the consumer for the respective use (service) For example, depending on the technology conversion, electricity becomes (e.g. light, mechanical energy or heat). Energy service Service that is provided by useful energy (E.g. light, mechanical energy or heat) In the reference energy system, we can observe that on the left side we have the technologies and activities that enable us to collect primary energy (the primary energy supply area), like oil extraction, coal mining, biomass collection, etc. Then, the second area refers to conversion technologies from primary to final energy supply and its transportation, like electricity generation on power plants or oil refining. In some cases, like biomass or natural gas, the primary energy is consumed directly as a commodity (it means final energy) and there is no conversion process. We have a second level of technologies which are the end-use technologies that allow us to change the final energy into a form of useful energy to perform different activities, like heating, mechanical movement or light, and these activities, which are not energy nor technologies, are the energy services. So, we present here the first definition of energy service that describes an activity that can be performed by means of useful energy. 1.2.1.1 Energy supply and the Energy demand The energy supply Energy that is extracted from nature. It is basically all the activities that allows extraction, transportation and storage of fuels. Usually energy supply refers to primary energy vectors. The energy demand Energy that is consumed by a particular system or economic sector. It is the energy required to provide the products and services and usually refers to final energy vectors.The energy demand may be described by technology (in the case of a building energy system) or by economic activity (in the case of a country’s energy system). Energy Conversion Process that describes the conversion from primary to final (or final to useful) Waste energy Energy lost in the conversion process 1.3 Energy Services Definition Energy Services (ES) is an expression that has been used over the last decade under different circumstances, referring to different meanings, though in general related with energy end-use and energy efficiency contexts. In particular, two ideas are nowadays associated with this expression: Energy services as a type of description of energy end-uses; Energy services as a certain type of business activity related to the management of energy end-uses; Though the definitions are different and somehow disjoint, they both refer to understanding energy uses beyond the accounting of the energy used at a certain equipment or appliance and suggest that this knowledge enables to design and implement new ways to use energy more efficiently. This concept is not yet fully consolidated and has been introduced in the literature over the last decades in order to consolidate the concept as it will be used in the rest of the course. The first formal definition was presented by Groscurth et al. in 1995 and it says that Energy services are the ends for which the energy system provides the means. In 2005, in the report Energy Services for the New Millennium, by the United Nations Development Programme and the World Bank, Energy Services have been defined as follows: Energy services refer to the services that energy and energy appliances provide or, in a simpler way, Energy services are the benefits that energy carriers produce for human well-being. In 2007, the International Energy Agency uses the term in the report “Energy for the New Millennium” as the actual services for which energy is used, e.g. heating a given amount of space to a particular temperature for a period of time. Finally, in 2010, Harvey published the book called “Energy Efficiency And The Demand For Energy Services” where he also uses energy end uses as energy services.Despite all previews sources, Energy Services has been in general most used when talking about Energy Service Companies, ESCOs, which as the definition proposed by the Department Of Energy of US are the companies that develop projects to save energy. This term refers explicitly to companies that provide the service related to energy. This is in line with the definition proposed in 1998 by the World Trade Organization, that described energy services in an international report about the liberalization of energy markets as the value added by energy goods which is different from the energy goods itself. So, finally, we present the energy service definition that will be used in the rest of the course which is that an energy service describes the value added by the use of energy. This definition may refer, as presented in the video Energy System, to the activities that result by means of useful energy, but may also refer to the commercial service provided by an ESCO. The point is that energy service is not measured in energy units, because it does not refer explicitly to energy but to an activity and therefore should be measured in the activity units (e.g. providing hot water, it should refer to the temperature at which the water is provided; transportation, it should refer to km travelled; pumping water it should refer to water height). 1.3.0.1 From useful energy to energy services Passive systems: where useful energy is delivered into and mostly lost as unwanted heat, in exchange for energy services such as thermal comfort, illumination and transport (Cullen et al., 2011) 1.4 Tools to describe Energy Systems 1.4.1 Energy balance Energy balance is a tabular representation of the energy system that presents in an aggregated way the amounts of energy used in given activities. (i.e. a reference energy system that is rotated 90º, with numerical values). Energy balances can be used to describe the use of energy in a country or a building.The thorough analysis of the energy balance can provide us with several information about how the energy system is designed and how it operates. The energy balance is a table where in the columns we have the energy vectors or products (primary or final or eventually useful) and in the rows we have the activities on the supply or the demand (or eventually the services).Then in each cell we place the amount of energy (primary or final) that was used in each activity (supply, conversion or energy end use). Energy commodities (fuels) are mainly bought for their heat-raising properties. They can also be converted into different products (derived fuels). Therefore it is useful to present the energy supply and energy consumption in energy units (terajoules or tons of oil equivalent). The format adopted is termed the energy balance. The energy balance allows to see the relative importance of the different fuels in their contribution to the economy. The energy balance is also the starting point for the construction of various indicators as well as analyses of energy efficiency. Eurostat’s energy balance has a format identical to that of the commodity balance but expressed in an energy unit. Key structural features of the IEA energy balance The key energy balance concepts are highlighted with different colour schemes in an exemplary energy balance table below.

In the case of a country, the activities may refer to extraction or mining of fossil fuels or the collection of renewable resources, called Production (which in fact is a term that should be avoided when talking about energy, as according to the first law of thermodynamics, energy cannot be produced or destroyed). We also have the imports (in the form of primary energy like coal or final, like electricity of refined fuels). 1.4.2 How energy is used in the residential sector in Portugal Focusing in Residential use (in the final energy demand area) we can see that electricity and combustible renewables (biomass) are the most important vectors, followed by gas and oil products. In this particular case, we cannot see here in this compact format, but these oil products correspond mostly to Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) products.The use of final energy as heat is very small (as in Portugal we only have a very small district heating network operating at the residential level). 1.4.3 Flux Diagrams 1.4.4 Sankey Diagram Sankey diagram is a graphical representation of flows in a system in which the width of the arrows is shown proportionally to the flow quantity. We can think about them as a mixture of the reference energy system and the energy balance. 1.4.4.1 Sankey diagram of the Portuguese energy system (IEA) Represents the flows between primary and final energy. Source IEA Direct Link We can see that: oil is still the most used energy resource and is mostly used for transportation; the losses; import and export flows; most oil products are locally refined and from those part is exported. electricity generation as a diverse mix of resources, from coal to gas and renewables. For Portugal, the gas is introduced in the 90’s and how the electricity from renewables is introduced in the 2000’s. Sankey diagrams should be extended to the energy service level Cullen and Allwood they have done the Sankey diagram of the world, extending it to the final energy service levels and the corresponding useful energy flows.

Cullen, Engineering Fundamentals of Energy Efficiency, PhD Thesis, Cam, Table 3.6 Technical components ranked by the scale of energy use p. 48, avaiable at: link We can see, for example, that communications requires today more energy than illumination and that the consumption of energy for hygiene is as large as consumption of fuel in passenger transportation.This gives us a new vision of how energy is consumed and can induce the new way of designing energy systems that are more efficient. 1.4.5 Energy around the World 1.4.5.1 World Sankey Diagram The world Sankey Diagram clearly describes the world energy system. On the demand side, the world energy demand is more or less divided equally into three parts:Transports, Industry and Other uses. However, there are a significant amount of energy uses which are energy products which are used as raw materials (e.g. oil products like asphalt for road construction or oil for lubricants). It is also obvious that almost all the transportation sector uses oil products and its derivatives; Industry has a more diverse energy mix as it uses: coal, gas and electricity and Others use Electricity, Gas and Biomass The Others sector refers to Residential, Commercial and Public Services Agriculture and Forestry, Fishing and Non-Specified Uses Taking into account that Residential, Commercial and Public Services are all developed in buildings we can see that a significant part of the Others sector is basically describing the energy demand in the Buildings sector. Though the statistics do not refer to a specific sector called buildings grew the demand in this sector is often consider as a proxy to the demand in Buildings, And in that case, we can see that it is one of the most important sectors in terms of demand. A special note related to Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing.The energy consumption in these sectors is usually considered very small, but in general it has to do with the account systems in these economic sectors (i.e. the Agriculture activity per se may involve some consumption of fuel in machines, but the production of fertilizers is a significant part of the Industry demand. This would not happen if energy statistics was based on energy services, where one of the services would be the Production of Food, and which would include the consumption of energy for fertilizers and the machines). We can also see in the diagram that electricity is generated mostly by coal, followed by gas. We see that all the renewables, including biomass and hydro, still represent only a part of electricity generation On the supply side, we see that Oil still represents a large share of primary energy supply consumption,followed by coal, gas and then biomass. 1.4.5.2 Total Primary Energy Supply by source Into detail to the main energy flows around the world. Let’s observe in detail the aggregated statistics for primary and final energy in the world. Source: IEA World Energy Balances 2017 Methodology Statistics 1.4.5.3 Primary Energy Consumption (World) Energy developments Primary energy consumption growth averaged 2.2% in 2017, up from 1.2 % last year and the fastest since 2013. This compares with the 10-year average of 1.7% per year. By fuel, natural gas accounted for the largest increment in energy consumption, followed by renewables and then oil. Energy consumption rose by 3.1% in China. China was the largest growth market for energy for the 17th consecutive year. Source: BP Statistical Review 1.4.5.3.1 Primary Energy: Consumption In this review, primary energy comprises commercially-traded fuels, including modern renewables used to generate electricity. USSR includes Georgia and the Baltic States. Excludes Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania prior to 1985 and Slovenia prior to 1990. Note: Growth rates are adjusted for leap years. The first graph describes the world final energy consumption. Over the last 40 years final energy consumption grew from 4000 megatons of oil equivalent to more than 14000 mtoe. 1.4.5.4 By fuel 1.4.5.5 Oil In 1973 oil represented almost fifty percent of the final energy consumption while in 2013 it represented only forty percent. Now it is less dominant but still there is a net growth. In 1973, oil represented almost forty-six percent of the final energy consumption while in 2013 represented only thirty-one percent, which means that today oil is almost all used for transportation but still there is a net growth. The most important growth was from coal and gas.Coal grew almost two times. Coal is almost today as important as oil but compared to the final energy demand we can see that the most of it is converted into electricity. Gas grew 3.5 times. It has replaced oil consumption in many applications like heating and generation and industry. Regarding the other vectors nuclear has been stable for the last three decades,Hydro is still the most important renewable energy resource and the others, like wind and solar, were not use except for the last decade. In general, economic development is highly correlated to energy consumption. 1.4.5.6 Natural Gas: Consumption 1.4.5.7 Coal Consumption 1.4.5.8 Nuclear 1.4.5.9 Hydroelectricity 1.4.5.10 Renewables: Consumption - Solar 1.4.5.11 Renewables: Consumption - Wind 1.4.5.12 Renewables: Consumption - Geothermal, Biomass and Other 1.4.5.13 Other Renewables: Consumption 1.4.5.14 Electricity generation by fuel (BP Stats, 2018) Electricity grew from less than ten percent, 400 megatons of oil equivalent to eighteen percent, which means it grew four times. Electricity has been increasing its importance and it’s today the second-largest where energy vector that is consumed and is ahead of natural gas. In terms of primary energy over last 40 years energy grew from 5,000 megatons to 13,000 megatons of oil equivalent, which means it grew more than the final energy. This indicates that the overall efficiency of conversion has decreased. Includes sources not specified elsewhere e.g. pumped hydro, non renewable waste and statistical discrepancies. ^ Less than 0.05. * Commonwealth of Independent States also sometimes called the Russian Commonwealth 1.4.5.15 OECD countries We can consider that the OECD countries are the ones that have in general attend a developed economy and none of the OECD countries are the developing countries. So it is expected that regions that have high economic growth require significant energy consumption growth while the ones that are already developed require less energy consumption. If we look to the primary energy supply by region and not by fuel, over the last 40 years, world primary energy grew mostly in developing countries. In fact, OECD countries’ energy consumption grew only from 3,000 to 4,000 megatons of oil equivalent and represents today less than forty percent compared, to the sixty percent in the seventies. Thus, we can see in the figure that in the OECD countries the energy consumption has not grown but rather is decreasing which means that only these economies are having more modest economic growth or most probably they are also having increasing their energy efficiency. We can see that the continuous growth of primary energy consumption in the world over the last 50 years has been mostly driven by non-OECD countries. This is particular to for China, in the late nineties, and many other emerging Asian economies. Finally, if we look into detail to the case of electricity generation we can see that over the last 40 years, electricity consumption grew from 5,000 terawatt-hours to more than 20,000. Most of electricity is generated in fossil thermal power plants, and from those mostly from coal, and that hydro power plants are the second largest electricity generators, ahead of nuclear. We can also see that despite the growth of wind and solar power plants in the last two decades the absolute weight in electricity generation is still very small. In 1973 fossil fuels represented more than seventy-five percent of generation but today they still represent over sixty percent.

Air temperature is a measure of the kinetic energy of air.It is measured with a dry bulb thermometer, which is a thermometer exposed to air but shielded from radiation and humidity. In space heating and temperature, when we talk about ambient temperature (the temperature of the surroundings) we assume, in general, that it is the air temperature We also have the mean radiant temperature concept, which is a measure of the amount of radiant heat transferred from a surface. The mean radiant temperature depends on the temperatures and emissivities of the surrounding surfaces as well as the view factor - the amount of the surface that is seen by the object. So the mean radiant temperature experienced by a person in a room with the sunlight streaming varies based on how much of his/her body is in the sun. Finally, the operative temperature concept, which combines the effects of the air and mean radiant temperatures into one metric only. It is often approximated as the average of air dry-bulb temperature and of the mean radiant temperature at the given place in a room.In buildings with low thermal mass, the operative temperature is sometimes considered to be simply the air temperature. 3.1.1 First law of thermodynamics The first law of thermodynamics tells us that when energy is transferred as work, as heat, or with matter, into or out of a system, the system’s internal energy changes in accordance to the law of conservation of energy. The difference between the conservation of energy in a close or open system is, in fact, that in an open system we have mass flow (for example outside air coming into a room) and this mass flow carries energy. This concept is fundamental to implement the heat balance in a control volume. 3.1.2 Second Law of Thermodynamics The Second Law of Thermodynamics implies that heat will not transfer from a colder to a hotter body without some external source of energy. We so have the heat transfer mechanisms whenever we have a temperature difference between two systems: e.g. the outside environment and the room or the room and the occupant. The heat gains through the building envelope (walls, windows, roofs and floors) occur through one of the heat transfer mechanisms: conduction, convection or radiation. Conduction mechanism refers to heat exchange through solid surfaces (i.e. the transfer of heat by the interactions of atoms or molecules of a material through which the heat is being transferred). Convection involves the transfer of heat by the mixing and motion of macroscopic portions of a fluid (i.e. to heat exchange between solid surfaces and moving fluids like a wall and air radiation mechanism refers to the heat exchange between two systems at different temperatures, like the exchange between the sky and a room through a transparent surface like a window). Radiation , or radiant heat transfer, involves the transfer of heat by electromagnetic radiation that arises due to the temperature of a body. Heat flux is the rate of heat transfer per unit area. Heat is energy transferred as a result of a temperature difference. Temperature is a measure of the amount of molecular energy contained in a substance. Work is a transfer of energy resulting from a force acting through a distance. Thermal conductivity is a measure of a substance’s ability to transfer heat through itself. Log mean temperature difference is the ∆T that most accurately represents the ∆T for a heat exchanger. The local heat transfer coefficient represents a measure of the ability to transfer heat through a stagnant film layer. The overall heat transfer coefficient is the measure of the ability of a heat exchanger to transfer heat from one fluid to another. The bulk temperature is the temperature of the fluid that best represents the majority of the fluid which is not physically connected to the heat transfer site. 3.1.2.1 Conservation of Energy Formula (Closed System) \\[\\Delta U = Q - W \\] Where: \\(\\Delta U\\) : as a change in internal energy \\(Q\\) : the net quantity of heat supplied to the system by its surroundings \\(W\\) : denotes the net work done by the system.

The simplified models use the physical principles of thermodynamics (first and second law), and heat and mass transfer and apply them to a control volume. It requires the definition of comfort conditions, and the climate influence. These type of models have been used for many years to determine the heat and cooling needs of closed spaces in buildings, and provide reasonable estimations.However, it requires several assumptions and the accuracy depends on the quality of the assumptions (and the corresponding data). 3.2.0.2 Thermal simulation Thermal simulation is the process of using computational tools, which are used in general in large buildings.In practice these tools implement the same principles of the simplified models, where each area in the building is a control volume. However, it enables to link all the areas and account for the heat and mass flow between the different areas.It requires the development of a geometric model of the space, the detailed characterization of constructive solutions, the list of the equipment and its schedules of use and, finally, also climate information. In general, we have a software tool to design the building and insert all the characterization, open tool or commercial, and then these tools use a computational tool that develops the thermal simulation.The most used tool is ENERGYPLUS, developed by the Department of Energy (DOE) of US. 3.3 Thermal Comfort The human body needs to maintain its temperature somewhere between 36ºC to 37ºC and we are able to do it reasonably well when the surrounding or ambient temperature is between 20ºC and 50ºC. That means that when the ambient temperature is below, our body starts to loose heat through radiation, convection, and conduction and we need to spend energy to keep it warm; if the ambient temperature is above, our body starts to gain heat through radiation, convection, conduction and we need to keep it cool. We feel cold when our skin temperature is under 37ºC. Then, the body initiates many mechanism to reduce heat losses: Vasoconstriction to decrease the flow of heat to the skin;No sweating; Shivering to produce heat at the muscle level Secretion of substances to increase heat production; and erection of hair to increase insulation. On the other hand we feel hot when our skin temperature is above 37ºC. The body only mechanism to loose heat is sweating, or evaporation of perspiration from the skin and the evaporative cooling from exhaled moisture. The external conditions that influence thermal comfort are: the ambient and radiant temperature, as it influences the heat exchange mechanism between the body and the environment the relative humidity (as it influencesthe rate of heat exchange through perspiration the air speed, as it influences the heat exchange through convection; our own metabolic rate (and the activity we are developing) the clothes that people wear,as they help to control heat exchange So, what is thermal Comfort? As defined by the ASHRAE Standard 55 (which is the Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy Standard), the thermal Comfort is basically a state of mind that expresses satisfaction about the thermal environment. By nature, is subjective meaning that different persons have different assessments of thermal comfort. In the literature we have two models that are considered to assess thermal comfort: the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) the adaptive model The Predicted mean vote is an index that predicts the mean value of the thermal sensation votes (self-reported perceptions) of a large group of persons on a sensation scale expressed from -3 to +3 corresponding to the categories “cold,”cool“,”slightly cool“,”neutral“,”slight warm“,”warm“, and”hot“. It was proposed by Fanger and it is based in an analytical model with a series of real experiments, and was latter adopted as an ISO standard. The original data was collected by subjecting a large number of people to different conditions within a climate chamber and having them select a position on the scale that best described their comfort sensation. A mathematical model of the relationship between all the environmental and physiological factors was considered and then derived from the data. This method treats all occupants as the same and disregards location and adaptation to the thermal environment. It basically states that the indoor temperature should not change as the seasons do. Rather, there should be one set temperature year-round. This is taking a more passive stand that humans do not have to adapt to different temperatures since it will always be constant. On the other hand the Adaptive model is a model that relates indoor design temperatures or acceptable temperature ranges to outdoor meteorological or climatological parameters. It is also based on the analyses of a database with results from 160 buildings, which revealed that occupants of naturally ventilated buildings accept and even prefer a wider range of temperatures than their counterparts in sealed, air conditioned buildings because their preferred temperature depends on outdoor conditions. In general, it is assumed that any human will feel thermal Comfort within the following general conditions: an ambient temperature between 20º and 27ºC a relative humidity between 30% to 60% So, this is represented in this psychrometric chart which is a chart that represents thermodynamic properties of moist air at constant pressure (1 atm) at sea level.

Fanger as \\[PMV = (0.303e ^{0.036M} + 0.028) L\\] where: \\(PMV\\) : Predicted Mean Vote Index \\(L\\) : thermal load - defined as the difference between the internal heat production and the heat loss to the actual environment - for a person at comfort skin temperature and evaporative heat loss by sweating at the actual activity level. 3.3.2 Hot water modeling Hot water is used in many different applications. One of the Main applications is for personal hygiene: bathing in households, hotels or hands washing in hospitals and toilets in buildings.Another application is for washing: dishes, laundry and other cleaning activities. The main important variables that determine the hot water services are: the water volume that is need to be heated; the outlet temperature of the water after it is heated; the inlet temperature of the water in the piping system before is heated; and finally the piping heat losses during transportation from the heating system to the usage point (the taps) The energy required to heat the water is given by the internal energy variation of the water volume that is going to be heated, which is basically given by: the product between the water mass (volume times the density of water), the specific heat at constant pressure of water (which is basically 4.18 kJ/kg K for the water temperature around 20ºC which is the value of 1 calorie) the temperature difference between the outlet temperature and the inlet temperature. The water volume depends on the water flow coming out of the outlets (taps or faucet,shower heads, etc.) and the time during which the outlets are open. Different types of outlets have different flows: for example a standard shower head has a flow of 10 to 20 L per minute, while a low-flow or efficient shower head has a flow of 5 to 10 L per minute. So, for the same shower period (for example 5 min), a standard shower head will require a 50 to 100 L volume of hot water, while the low flow shower head will require only 25 to 50 L. This means that depending on the shower head, the water usage and the energy to heat the water, might be the double of the required. A standard sink faucet has also a flow of 10 to 20 L, which means that using a sink faucet during 1 minutes consumes as much hot water as a dish washer machine cycle. The final temperature depends on the usage. For example, water at 60 ºC during 5 s will cause skin scalding - so, the shower temperature should never be above 45 ºC. 3.3.2.1 Legionella bacteria However, if the technology that is used to produce the hot water has a storage tank, than the water needs to be stored at 60ºC and distributed such that the outlet temperature is never below 55ºC, in order to avoid the growth of legionella bacteria in the piping and storage system (remember that the legionella is the bacteria responsible for the legionnaire’s respiratory disease and it can be found in environments with fresh water (tanks, pipes) where the temperature is between 25 and 45 ºC. The bacteria is killed at temperatures above 60 ºC and will hibernate at temperatures below 20ºC. The initial temperature is the temperature at which the water is distributed in the piping system before it is heated. It depends on the climate conditions: usually is lower in winter and warmer in the summer and even in mild climates it can easily vary in 5ºC from winter to summer. The European Guidelines for Control and Prevention of Travel Associated Legionnaires’ Disease recommend that hot water should be stored at 60 °C (140 °F) and distributed such that a temperature of at least 50 °C (122 °F) and preferably 55 °C (131 °F) is achieved within one minute at points of use. 3.4 Influence of climate 3.4.1 Degree Days The main energy end-use in buildings around the world is space heating, in particular in regions with cold climates.The degree days are a very simple and direct methodology to estimate the impact of the climate of a certain region in the heating and cooling needs of the building. If it is used for estimate: heating needs, we use the heating degree days (HDD) cooling needs, we use the cooling degree days (CDD). Due to the simplicity, it also has some limitations. In any case, the general method to estimate the heating needs but it is not so used to estimate the cooling needs. As the name says (degree days), this indicator is a product between time (in days) and temperature (in degrees). It basically tries to estimate by calculating how many days of a year a certain place has a temperature under a certain reference level. It can be computed with daily data (or hourly data integrated to a day). In general, the reference temperature is the outside temperature at which people start to use heating appliances, for example 15º or 16ºC, the exterior temperature is the temperature measured by weather stations. The cooling degree days calculation is very similar. The reference temperature is the outside temperature at which people start to use cooling appliances, for example 25ºC or 27ºC, and the exterior temperature is the temperature measured by weather stations. So, for example, assuming 25ºC as the reference temperature, one day with an average daily temperature of 22ºC has 0 CDD. On the other hand, one day with an average daily temperature of 30ºC has 5 CDD. The formula is similar to HDD. Notice however that in general, CDD are not considered as good estimates as HDD. 3.4.2 HDD (Heating Degree Days) \\[HDD (T_{ref}) =\\frac{1}{24}\\sum_{8760}^{i=1} max (T_{ref}- T_{ext, i} , 0)\\] Where: \\(T_{ref}\\) : reference temperature \\(T_{ext}\\) : exterior temperature \\(i\\) : inlet temperatures of hot/cold fluid It measures the product between the number of days and the number of degrees that the interior temperature is lower (heating) or higher (cooling) than a certain comfort temperature 3.4.3 CDD (Cooling Degree Days) \\[CDD (T_{ref}) =\\frac{1}{24}\\sum_{8760}^{i=1} max (T_{ref, i}- T_{ext} , 0)\\] 3.4.4 Heating Degree Days (HDD) and Cooling Degree Days (CDD) in Europe In terms of HDD in Europe, we can see that the Northern countries can reach 6000 HDD per year. In central Europe this value varies between 2000 and 4000 HDD per year, while on the South (especially in Mediterranean areas) the HDD vary between 600 and 1000 HDD. In terms of CDD, the data is some more or less reversed. In general in Europe, the cooling needs estimate, using degree days is significantly smaller than heating needs. In particular, in Northern Europe and in Central and Eastern Europe, it is usually less than 200 CDD per year while in the South (in the Mediterranean countries) it varies between 600 and 1000 CDD per year This is aligned with the energy consumption data we have analyzed for Europe.

We have four mechanisms that we need to consider: The heat gains through the envelope (conduction, convection and radiation) - The air mass balance due to natural or artificial ventilation and air leakages through windows frames; Compute solar gains, usually from radiation heat exchange between the room and the sun or the night sky and - The internal gains. The heat transfer through the envelope consists of applying the first law of thermodynamics to a closed system. In the case of a closed system, we have that the internal variation depends on the heat exchange through the borders of the system: walls, windows, floors, ceilings and roofs. The direction of the heat flow through envelope is basically determined by the temperature difference between the air temperature of the room and the outside temperature. In general we consider convection and conduction exchanges together, thus we use the global heat transfer coefficient U, which includes the conduction and convection coefficients. This coefficient depends on the material (or combination of materials) conductivity, k, and its thickness, L. In general, the calculation of this heat flow through any surface is done using the electric analogous, where the heat flow is equivalent to current, the temperature difference is the voltage difference and the inverse of the thermal conductivity is the electrical resistance. The internal gains are the gains caused by the heat release of occupants and appliances. In general, these gains are estimated considering an average value per area. However, a more detailed calculation can be done. In the case of the heat generated by occupants, it depends on either their clothes, metabolism and activity. It is measured in met - metabolism equivalent of task - which corresponds to the release of 58.15 W/m2. As the average body area of a human being is 1.75 m2, 1 met is considered to be the heat released by an adult resting (which corresponds to 100 W), when writing the occupant may release 140-180 W, while doing workout can release 300-400 W. Regarding the appliances, any electric appliance like computers and TVs releases heat, usually due to the power sources conversion and the processors. The lights also loose heat by radiation and convection. Electrical appliances release in general the equivalent to 100 W/m2, while artificial light is considered to be 8 W/m2.The number of hours that the equipments are turned on also impacts the internal gains. In these internal gains we do not consider the heat gains related to equipment’s that are specifically used for heating (and cooling), like fireplaces, radiators, or AC system. Whenever we have a mass exchange in a control volume, there is an energy gain or loss, depending on the temperature and relative humidity conditions between the air mass inside the system and the new mass that is coming in or out. By applying the 1st law of thermodynamics to the control volume, we can see that it depends on the temperature difference and the mass flow. Finally, the solar gains refers to the increase in temperature within a closed space that results from the heat gains through radiation with the sun.The amount of solar gain increases with the radiation intensity, due to season or hour of the day, and with the ability of a material (window, wall) to transmit or reflect the radiation. In general, opaque surfaces, like walls, resist to solar gains, while transparent surfaces, like windows, transmit solar gains. 3.5.0.1 Thermal Balance \\[Q= Q_{in} - Q_{out} = Q_{walls} + Q_{windows}+ Q_{roof}+ Q_{ceiling}\\] 3.5.0.2 Ventilation and Air Leakages \\[\\dot{Q} = \\dot{m}cp\\Delta T\\] Where: \\(cp\\) : surface pressure coefficient \\(\\Delta T\\) : temperature difference 3.5.0.3 Overall Heat Transfer Coefficient (U) \\[Q = U\\Delta T\\] \\[U = \\frac{1}{1/h1 + La/Ka + 1/h2}\\] Where: \\(q\\) : heat transfer (W, J/s, Btu/h) \\(A\\) : heat transfer area (\\(m^2, ft^2\\)) \\(k\\) : thermal conductivity of material (W/m K or W/m oC, Btu/(hr or ft2/ft)) \\(dT\\) : temperature gradient - difference - in the material (K or oC, oF) \\(s\\) : material thickness (m, ft) 3.5.0.4 Heat Balance \\[Q = Q_{heating/cooling} + Q_{envelope} + Q_{internal}+ Q_{air}\\] 3.5.0.5 Heat through envelope \\[Q_{envelope} = HDD\\times Q_{x}\\] \\[Q_{x} = A_{ceiling} \\times U_{ceiling} \\times A_{floor} \\times U_{floor} A_{window} \\times U_{window} + ( A_{wall} - A_{window }) \\times U_{wall}\\] 3.5.0.6 Heat through air exchange \\[Q = \\dot{m} _{leakage} \\times Cp \\times V \\times HDD\\] Where: \\(V\\) : Volume of the room 3.5.0.7 Internal Gains \\[Q_{internal} = Q_{occupants} + Q_{appliances}\\] 3.5.0.8 Solar Gains \\[Q_{solar} = AI [T+U(\\sigma^\\alpha)]\\] Where: \\(A\\) : Area \\(I\\):irradiation \\(TU(\\sigma^\\alpha)\\) : Coefficient that depends on the transmissivity and the absorbed radiation by the surface, through each radiation enters the room 3.6 Simplified Heating and Cooling Services Modeling When we are modeling the space heating and cooling needs, the first step consists in defining the control volume, by indicating the geometry of the space and the materials of the surfaces (and the corresponding properties like the width, thermal resistance, transmittance, etc.) Then, we need to determine the climate conditions and for that we consider the heating degree days as an estimate for heating needs; and the cooling degree days as an estimate for cooling needs, knowing that the CDD do not work as good as HDD as an estimator for cooling needs, mostly because solar gains is summer are determinant for cooling needs. Then, we need to perform the heat balance, knowing that there are four components: the heat gains through the envelope the internal gains the gains through leakages or ventilation the solar gains The gains through the envelope consists of multiplying the HDD or CDD by the product of the area and the global heat transfer coefficient of the materials in walls, floors, windows and ceiling. For the heat exchange through air (ventilation or leakages) we multiple the air flow from the ventilation system (mechanical or natural) by the volume of the room, the specific heat of air and the temperature difference, which may be also extrapolated through HDD or CDD. The air flow may be represented also as a renovation rate, i.e. the amount of air volume that is replaced within a certain time period (like 1 hour). The internal gains, we need to evaluate the gains due to occupants (which depend on the number of occupants, the activity level and the schedule of occupation) and the appliances gains (which depend on the appliances and the number of hours they are used). In general, an average value per floor area is used. Finally, the solar gains are computed as heat exchange through radiation, which is the only heat transfer mechanism that does not depend directly from the temperature difference. Thus, it is usually computed through the linearized expression called linearized radiative heat transfer coefficient. This tells us that the solar gains depend on the area, the solar irradiation and a coefficient that depends on the transmissivity and the absorbed radiation by the surface, through each the radiation enters the room. 3.6.0.1 Material Simple glaze window Double Glaze window Simple break wall Double brick wall with air cavity Concrete floor Wood floor Ceiling 3.6.0.2 Hot water modelling Changing Product Temperature - Heating up the Product with Steam The amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a substance can be expressed as: \\[\\Delta U = m c_{p} \\Delta T\\] Where: \\(\\Delta U\\) : quantity (difference) of energy or heat (kJ) \\(m\\) : mass of substance (kg) \\(c_{p}\\) : specific heat of substance (kJ/kg K) \\(\\Delta T\\) : temperature (difference) rise of substance \\(c_{p}\\) 4.18 kJ/kg.K 3.6.0.3 Pipe Losses Finally, like in any system, the hot water distribution will generate losses in pipes due to conduction and convection losses. These losses are especially important when the hot water generation device is far away from the distribution point (more losses require that the generating system produces hot water at higher temperatures). The losses also depend on the material of the pipes and the insulation material and thickness that is used). The losses by conduction in a pipe depend on the temperature difference between the water flowing in the pipe and the outside temperature, the thermal conductivity of the pipe and insulation material and the area, which is the area of a cylinder, and the thickness of the pipe which depend on the outer and inner diameters. \\[q_{p}= \\pi (T_{2}-T_{1})/ ln (D_{out}/D)\\] 3.6.1 References EnergyPlus Url: https://energyplus.net/ Heat Transfer Terminology Summary (DOE Fundamentals Handbook Thermodynamics, Heat Transfer, and Fluid Flow) https://www.steamtablesonline.com/pdf/Thermodynamics-Volume1.pdf ASHARAE Standard 55 - Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy Link: https://www.ashrae.org/resources--publications/bookstore/standard-55-and-user-s-manual Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) Fanger, P.

Since the specific humidity takes very low values in climatization situations, the psychrometric chart is defined by the axis of dry temperature and specific humidity. Generally, the following values are considered for specific heat and enthalpy of phase: \\[h = 1.01\\times T + w(1.9T + 2480)\\] B.0.0.19 Relative humidity The relative humidity is calculated by the ratio between the effective vapor pressure and the maximum vapor pressure.

B.0.0.37 Annuity Let \\(a_{n}\\) denote the present value of the annuity. As the present value of the \\(j^{th}\\) payment is \\(v^{j}\\), where v = 1/(1+i) is the discount factor, the present value of the annuity is: \\[a_{n}= v + v^{2} + v^{3}+...+ v^{n}\\] \\[= v \\times\\left [ \\frac{1-v^n}{1-v} \\right ]\\] \\[= \\frac{1-v^n}{i}\\] \\[= \\frac{1-(1+i)^{-n}}{i}\\] The accumulated value of the annuity at time \\(n\\) is denoted by \\(s_{n}\\) This is the future value of ane at time \\(n\\). Thus, we have: \\[s_{n} = s_{n} \\times (i+1)^n\\] \\[s_{n} =\\frac{(1+i)^{n}-1}{i}\\] If the annuity is of level payments of P, the present and future values of the annuity are \\(Pa_n\\) and \\(Ps_n\\), respectively. Given that A = annual repayment amount, the present value of one annual repayment amount paid in t years time is \\[P= \\frac{A}{(1+i)^t}\\],where \\(i\\) is the annual rate of interest expressed as a decimal or fraction Given that A = annual repayment amount, the present value of one annual repayment amount paid in t years time is Loan amount = sum of the present value of all the repayments (assuming payment at the end of each payment period) Where: \\(P\\) = Loan amount \\(A\\) = periodic repayment amount, \\(t\\) = the number of payment periods, \\(i\\) = the interest rate for the payment period expressed as a decimal or fraction \\[P =\\frac{A}{(1+i)} + \\frac{A}{(1+i)^2} + \\frac{A}{(1+i)^3} + .... \\frac{A}{(1+i)^t}\\] \\[A =\\frac{1}{(1+i)} + \\frac{1}{(1+i)^2} + \\frac{1}{(1+i)^3} + .... \\frac{1}{(1+i)^t}\\] \\[\\Rightarrow A = P\\frac{i(1+i)^t}{(1+i)^t-1}\\] This type of calculation is so common that it is convenient to derive a formula to shortcut the calculation for the regular repayment \\(A\\). By considering the general case of an amortised loan with interest rate \\(i\\), taken out over \\(t\\) years, for a loan amount of \\(P\\), a geometric series can be used to derive the general formula: \\[A= P\\frac{i(1+i)^t}{(1+i)^t-1}\\] B.0.0.38 Net Present Value (NPV) \\[NPV_{i, N} \\sum_{n=0}^{N}\\frac{C_n}{(1+i)^n} - Investment\\] When cash inflows are even: \\[NPV = C × 1 − (1 + i)^{-n} − Initial \\ Investment\\] In the above formula, \\(C\\) is the net cash inflow expected to be received in each period; \\(i\\) is the required rate of return per period; \\(n\\) are the number of periods during which the project is expected to operate and generate cash inflows.
